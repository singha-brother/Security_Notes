summary: |-
  The researcher discovered a URL parameter reflecting its value without being properly sanitized and was able to achieve reflected XSS. In addition, researcher found an endpoint which was vulnerable to CSRF.
  The endpoint allowed to set a new password on accounts which had used third-party apps to sign-up. Researcher combined both vulnerabilities to achieve a "one click account takeover".
  While fuzzing, I discovered a URL parameter reflecting its value without being properly sanitized. Thus, I was able to achieve reflected XSS. In addition, I found an endpoint which was vulnerable to CSRF.
  The endpoint enabled me to set a new password on accounts which had used third-party apps to sign-up. I combined both vulnerabilities by crafting a simple JavaScript payload - triggering the CSRF - which I injected into the vulnerable URL parameter from earlier, to archive a "one click account takeover".
