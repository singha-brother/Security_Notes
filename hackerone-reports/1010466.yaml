summary: |-
  I found a XSS when I send a image in the support chat and change the image name to some script.
  The CSRF part you can ignore, since the hacker can inject XSS in the support, then send a message (as support) with the XSS image to every user.
  Yeah, it is a massive XSS, tons of users would be affected.
  The CSRF vulnerability make a request for support.cs.money/upload_file; This upload_file does not have csrf token/ origin/ reference verification!
  The XSS allows to execute JS. The payload of the XSS stay in the param 'filename' of the CSRF request.
poc: |-
  XSS
  - Start a chat with support;
  - Configure a proxy as a burp suite in your browser;
  - Send a valid image and change the filename to \" onerror = \"alert(123)\" \" ;
  - You will be redirected to cs.money, click on the support chat.
  - You will see an alert(123), the support agent will also see this when accessing your chat!
  CSRF
  - Host the file where I explained the CSRF to a server, such as 000webhost, with the name of Ê»index.php`
  - Take the link to your file and shorten it, (bit.ly) with a more friendly link; or use a domain like csmoney.shop
  - Now the hacker can send the link to users who have active chat via discord or another means.
impact: |-
  - I could create and send a payload to the support agent, and the payload would respond as support agent to all users who have already contacted him with another payload.
  - Users would receive a notification and click, running XSS.
  - The XSS will run on cs.money (main domain), so it is possible to steal personal data, make requests, have total control over the user!
  - The content of the page can be altered by a malicious one, such as a message to download a new update of the extension of cs money, which is actually something that can steal the password of the account of steam and other websites.
