summary: |-
  "Due to a configuartion in frontend, caching servers, it was possible for a researcher to use request smuggling to convert a page request into a cached redirect. If the cached redirect were accessed by a legitimate user, an attacker's content would be rendered instead of the requested page. While this would not impact any back-end data, this could interfere with the integrity of the certain pages, including potential interference with the sign-in page."
