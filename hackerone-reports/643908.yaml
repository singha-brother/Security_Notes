summary: |-
  Ali found a stored XSS vulnerability in the JavaScript implementation of workflow keywords on our Trac instance. The issue was caused by using unescaped user input to generate a delete button. A fix has been implemented to use the safe jQuery method .attr() instead.
  Important: As mentioned in our policy, do not pentest our Trac instances, it's very annoying to clean up after. Setup a local environment instead; the custom source code is available via Git (git clone git://meta.git.wordpress.org/), in the trac.wordpress.org subfolder. If you ignore this you'll forfeit any bounty.
